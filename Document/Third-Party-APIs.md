● Third-Party APIs:

• I will integrate some third party APIs in my marketplace:

1. Clerk Auth.
2. ShipEngine Or Shippo.
3. Payment Gateway.

● Clerk Auth: 

Integrating Clerk Auth is essential in my marketplace since, I will be storing orders with refrence to clerk Auth, that means customer will be redirected to sign-in page when he clicks on checkout button in Cart, after signing in he can place order, and his order in sanity studio will contain a field called clerkId, by which when he tried to view orders in Order page I will fetch orders made by him. And also it helps in assigning role's since there would be admin panel which only admin has access to, so protecting that page is essential.

● ShipEngine Or Shippo:

Integrating one of these shipment APIs is essential, for providing customer with real-time order tracking, Estimeted deliver time, shipment rates and shipment price if necessary.

● Payment Gateways:

In my opinion Authentic payment gateways are must for a full fledge market place since, I cannot always rely on customer to make payments then place order, right now if a customer places his order his order will get posted to sanity order studio, but with payment gateway I can insure that no order will get placed once payment is successfull.
